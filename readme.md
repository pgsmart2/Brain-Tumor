# Brain Tumor AI Detector 
## Features
This AI model can identify if a tumor exists in a brain and then identify it into 3 different common categories: Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary. Information about the tumors is also provided like cancer commonness and growth. It takes an MRI scan image that is uploaded by the user and then analyzed by the model, and then the results are shown to the user.
